# Quadratic Equations Solver
Quadratic Equations Solver (complex number included).

My friend has an idea to make a simple quadratic equations solver that contains either complex number or integer numbers only.<br>
I use simple quadratic equations (abc formula) to find the 1st x and the 2nd x.<br>
general form of quadratic equations:

![equations](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B150%7D%20%5Clarge%20ax%5E%7B2%7D%20&plus;%20bx%20&plus;%20c)

How to use:
* Input the a, b, c. Separate them using spaces (example: 1 5 4)
* The program will do the formula to find the 1st x and 2nd x

> This program has 3 conditions. These are when the D > 0, D = 0, and D < 0

When the D > 0, it has 2 solutions of x.<br>
When the D = 0, the 1st x has the same value with the 2nd x which means it has just 1 solution of x.<br>
When the D < 0, it doesn't have solutions for real number. But, it has solutions in complex number.<br>

Sample input 0 (D > 0)
```
1 5 4
```
Sample output 0
```
x1, x2 :  -1.00, -4.00
```
Sample input 1 (D = 0)
```
1 -6 9
```
Sample output 1
```
x :  3.00
```
Sample input 2 (D < 0)
```
1 3 6
```
Sample output 2
```
x1 : -1.50+1.94i 
x2 : -1.50-1.94i
```

Use it wisely. Don't use it in wrong way. Don't cheating on your exam!
